## Technical Challenges
For this project, we had to learn how to extract data from upload files, integrate with text-to-speech and speech-to-text APIs, and learn how to use the IBM Watson API.

## Video Demo / Screen shot walkthrough of the app
[Gifs to be inserted]

Richard has just gotten the main role of Romeo at his local theater. He excitedly gets home and opens his favorite app to practice his new role: Script.ly. When Richard logs in to the app, his home page prompts two options: Upload or Record. Richard uploads a copy of the script and the app analyzes the text, which should send back an analysis on the tone of the text. Based on these results, Richard can emphasize on acting out these tones to enhance his performance (e.g. display emotions of happiness on parts of the text that have a joyous sentiment).

Sophia is preparing for her upcoming campaign speech. Usually her secretary writes down everything she says, but it’s the middle of the night and this is an important speech: Her presidential speech. Sophia opens Script.ly on her browser, hits the Record button, and the words just flow naturally to her: she speaks with great emotion, her confidence speaks volumes, and delivers her speech with grace. After 30 minutes, she stops recording and to her surprise, her speech is already written! Sophia reads over her freshly made script, makes a few edits, and hits the Analyze button. An Emotion chart renders on the page, she inspects the full document summary which displays five emotions: Sadness 51.6%, Joy 33.68%, Fear 0.59%, Disgust 3.86%, Anger 9.88%. Sophia thinks “Sadness? I don’t want my voters to perceive sadness in this speech! I should lower Sadness and Increase Joy”. She gives her script a few tweaks and finally, her script is done. A full day’s work was done in less than an hour. Happily, she saves the script and goes to bed feeling confident she has an outstanding speech.
